At the time, I had been itching to illustrate some Boston buildings, so when this project rolled around I immediately started thinking about how to incorporate that into my game. The final concept I went with was inspired by this one time I went on a run down Boylston St and tripped flat onto my face trying to dodge something on the sidewalk. I decided to take that experience and turn it into a fun game of dodging the various things one might find on the sidewalks in Boston! I spent just as much time on the illustrations as I did the programming, and it was so much fun to play with these shapes, colors, and sky elements!!' %}

Initially, the main character started out as a static image similar to the obstacles, but after iteration I decided it felt too unnatural and proceeded to have fun making her walk and do a split in the air (tbh the main character is a cartoon version of me)' %}
