        <h2>research  & discovery</h2>
        <p>Our clients approached us with a concept in mind: they wanted to create a mobile app experience that made its users feel as though they were walking down Newbury with their friends, but with the comfort and ease that shopping online provides. With this in mind, we dove head first into conducting user surveys, compiling resources and research into the shopping experience, doing branding exercises with the client, and just wrapping our heads around what Zealery could be.
          <br>
          Our team of five followed an Agile/scrum process, modified for an extended research phase that ran concurrently with our branding phase. </p>
